# 2023 Leaving Certificate Design and Communications Graphics Project
Bedside alarm clocks are primarily designed to wake people from their sleep at a particular time.
They come in analogue, digital and more recently in smart form. Their shape and form is
underpinned by a wide variety of geometry and they are available in a range of materials and
colours. Some alarm clocks can be turned off in innovative ways. Design features of a bedside
alarm clock may include time display, snooze buttons, programmable alarm options, Bluetooth,
etc.
## (a) 
Carry out a design investigation of existing bedside alarm clocks in graphic format. Your
investigation should include an analysis of physical forms and shapes, geometry, materials,
innovation, etc.
## (b)
Show graphically how you would physically modify a chosen bedside alarm clock to improve
its overall design.
### or
Develop and graphically communicate a new concept design for a bedside alarm clock based
on a selected theme or target market.
